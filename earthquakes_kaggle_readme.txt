The earthquakes dataset is an extensive collection of data containing information about all the earthquakes recorded worldwide from 1990 to 2023. The dataset comprises approximately three million rows, with each row representing a specific earthquake event. Each entry in the dataset contains a set of relevant attributes related to the earthquake, such as the date and time of the event, the geographical location (latitude and longitude), the magnitude of the earthquake, the depth of the epicenter, the type of magnitude used for measurement, the affected region, and other pertinent information.
